# The Cozy Cup - Coffee Shop Website

This project is a complete 4-page coffee shop website generated from a single category prompt (Coffee Shop). It uses Tailwind CSS via CDN, a coffee-focused color palette, and category-appropriate typography.

Files included:
- index.html — Home page with hero, signature drinks, about, testimonials, gallery, and call-to-action.
- about.html — About page with our story, values, and team.
- menu.html — Menu page featuring beverages and pastries with prices.
- contact.html — Contact page with store info and a functional message form.
- README.md — This documentation.

Key design notes:
- Theme: Coffee Shop
- Primary color: #3C2415 (dark coffee) / Secondary: #8B4513 (espresso) / Accent: #D2B48C (latte) / Background: #F5DEB3 (coffee cream)
- Typography: Headings use Montserrat; body uses a clean sans-serif (Tailwind defaults). Fonts are loaded via Google Fonts where possible.
- Layout: Mobile-first, responsive grid layout, semantic HTML5 structure, and accessible markup (alt attributes for all images, proper headings).
- Navigation: 4 pages linked from a single navigation bar; internal navigation is fully functional.

How to run locally:
1) Open the HTML files in a browser. No build step is required.
2) Optional: If you host this on a server, ensure Tailwind CDN remains accessible. You can also replace the CDN with a local build of Tailwind for production.

Customization tips:
- Change the background image placeholders in each section to real assets by replacing the image placeholders with your own URLs.
- Adjust text content to reflect your brand voice.
- Update the item names and prices in the menu to match your offerings.
- Update the footer with your store information and social links.
